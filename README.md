Web Exercise 1
#### My dataset is
<a href = "https://data.wa.gov/Transportation/Electric-Vehicle-Population-Data/f6w7-q2d2"> Electric cars information in the U.S </a>
##### I chose this dataset because, in my opinion, it is really important to know data about electric cras, because there are cars nowadays that are not electric and they pollute massive amounts of lethal smokes. So it is very important to analize electric ones in order to promote them instead of the other ones


#### My selected book is 
<a href = "" > Introduction to Metadata </a>
##### The reason why I selected this book is because I think that we are not aware of how important Metadata is in terms of Big data Science because it gives much structure and context to manage very complicated datasets, in order to find a better way to treat the data.
